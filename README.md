# Creating-Panoramas-using-Image-Stitching
An automated image stitching system that produces
seamless panoramic images from either a set of images with overlapping fields of view or frames
extracted from a short video. It takes images/video frames as input and combines
them into a single unified panorama spanning the full horizontal field of view captured. The output
is a high-resolution panoramic image stitching the aligned images/frames together into a wide vista.
